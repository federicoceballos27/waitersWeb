            <cite><b>"If you want to know someone, watch how they treat the waiter."</b></cite>
            <br>
            <p>We have all been to a restaurant at one time or another. The frequency of our visits can vary, as can the restaurant
            and the menu, but <b>there is one thing that will never change... and that is the presence of the waiter.</b> 
            These uniformed characters have the titanic task of serving hundreds of diners 
            with the best disposition and a broad smile. They show respect and expect that respect in return.</b></p>

            <p>The treatment that the customer gives to a waiter is essential when it comes to reciprocity -good service-, 
            because it usually happens that, <b>due to the speed of life, we forget the important role that these people play in a 
            restaurant.</b></p>

            <p>Treating those who serve you as equals and always being friendly talks about unconditional compassion and empathy
            for people as a whole, without condition.
            </b></p>

            <p><b>Everyone is the same </b>. The behaviors we display with waiters and waitresses, how we relate to them, and the way we treat 
            them can reveal a lot about one's personality. Everyone is human. 
            Everyone is equally important, regardless of their status according to their job title.</p>

            <p><b>We have made a list of some tips to treat a waiter well,
            in such a way that you can aspire to receive the best care.</b></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><i>Put yourself in the waiter place: first thing.</li>
                <li>Say hello: the greeting shows respect towards the other person.</li>
                <li>Call the waiter by their names: do not use strange sounds or derogatory names.</li>
                <li>Use the word "please" and "thank you": show respect and always look them to their faces.</li>
                <li>Do not blame the waiter: if the dish arrives late at your table or is not what you expected the problem almost comes from the kitchen. If the delay has been very rude, talk to the person in charge of customer service or a superior in the restaurant.</li>
                <li>Do not call the waiter if you're not ready to order yet: check the menu with peace of mind. When you have any questions about the menu or the ready decision, lick it and make your order or the pertinent questions.</li>
                <li>Be careful about asking the waiter for advice on the menu or some dish: although they are almost always successful, sometimes they are not on the same gastronomic tune as the diner.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>The work of a waiter should be rewarded and it is a tradition that after good service they are given a good tip as
            a thank you</b>. This will depend on the restaurant since sometimes the tip is included in the bill, but if a tip is
            not stipulated in the payment of the bill be fair with the tip given according to the attention received. <b>It is 
            common practice to leave 10% of the bill in tips, but if you want you can leave more!</b></i></p>
